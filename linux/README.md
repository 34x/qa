# Linux basics

In this chapter you will learn how to:

- navigate through files and folders in Linux (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`)
- create files and edit them (`touch`, `nano`, `echo`)
- create folders (`mkdir`)
- display content of a file (`cat`, `head`, `tail`)
- make http requests (`curl`)
- search in file (`grep`)
- combine different commands to work together (`;`, `&&`, `|`)

## Commands and their arguments

### Navigation

`pwd` - print working directory - the directory where you are currently.

`cd` - change directory e.g. `cd /var/www` will change current directory to `/var/www`.
