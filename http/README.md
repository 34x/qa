# HTTP

## Overview

> The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen. HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.

> In non technical words **http** is the way to get and to send information

> The **Hypertext** is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access.[1] Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set or by touching the screen. Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks.

## Request
> The **http request** defines methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource.
>
> **The three most common HTTP methods are: GET, POST and HEAD**
>
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
>
> The **GET** method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect
>
> The **HEAD** method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content
>
> The **POST** method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.
